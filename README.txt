# 🎙 Podcast Management System

The **Podcast Management System** is a software application designed to manage podcasts, episodes, and related information efficiently.  
It allows users or administrators to organize content, maintain records, and perform operations such as adding, updating, searching, and deleting podcast data.

This project was developed as part of my Computer Engineering studies to practice programming, object-oriented design, and data management.
